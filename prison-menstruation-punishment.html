While some identify as trans and gender-nonbinary, they all have similar reproductive health concerns. 90% of people in women’s jails and prisons are <a href=# rel=noopener>below the age of 55</a>, and for them, those concerns include monthly periods. This means that every month, every time they menstruate, they face an additional layer of humiliation and dehumanization.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a criminal-justice reporter and an oral historian, we collected first-hand accounts from prisoners as part of a global oral history project about menstruation. What we discovered, from correspondence with multiple writers incarcerated in different states, is a system that weaponizes menstruation as a form of punishment and oppression.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One such incarcerated writer is Kwaneta, a woman imprisoned in Texas. She told us that each month, her allotment of pads and tampons isn’t enough.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In prison, we’re strip-searched often. Before we leave our cell. Before and after work. Each time we must remove our pad or tampon,” she wrote. “We’re assigned one pack of pads and five regular-size tampons monthly. If you’re one of the heavy bleeders, women who have fibroids or are premenopausal, the state will not provide you any extra items. You must purchase them. We aren’t paid to work in Texas. And nothing is free in prison.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She continued, “I’ve had guards open every single pad and tampon to check for contraband. Now the tampons are contaminated. There’s no need to open a sealed package, but they do. I’m just so thankful I can afford the box of tampons to replace them.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If Kwaneta, or any woman, needs more supplies, she must purchase them from the commissary, the prison’s sole store. But Texas prisoners are not paid at their prison-assigned jobs, and a box of tampons in Texas prisons costs $15 (In contrast, the <a href=# rel=noopener>average</a> cost of a box of tampons in drugstores outside of prison is from $5 to $8).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Florida Politicians Want Less Talk About Periods. We Need More of It</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many incarcerated women don’t have family members who can send money. That leaves them little choice but to stuff their panties with wads of toilet paper (which is also rationed behind bars) and hope that they don’t bleed through onto their white jumpsuits. Often, the best solution, Kwaneta explained, especially for the most desperate and poor, is to eliminate their period through birth control, which is oddly more available in Kwaneta’s prison than basic menstrual care items.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But a lack of supplies isn’t the only assault on dignity. While collecting testimonies, we also heard the following:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A guard can supply a woman with her allotment of pads, but deny her the underwear she needs in order to wear the pad in the first place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Someone on their period may be given supplies, but denied trash cans to dispose of soiled items.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During strip-searches, women are corralled into one area where a guard will order anyone menstruating to remove their tampons. One woman described routinely stepping onto other women’s menstrual blood on the floor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A menstrual blood stain on a prison uniform becomes a reason to be singled out, called “lazy” and shamed by guards.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There is no privacy behind bars. Even changing your pads or tampons is an occasion for guards to watch.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lawmakers have made some attempts to introduce legislative protections around menstrual care for incarcerated people. In 2017, Senators Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill called the <a href=# rel=noopener>Dignity For Incarcerated Women Act,</a> requiring that federal prisons <a href=# rel=noopener>supply menstrual care products</a>. Two weeks later, the federal prison system <a href=# rel=noopener>announced</a> that it would provide period products free of charge, a change that was later codified as part of the <a href=# rel=noopener>First Step Act.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, this federal legislation affects only those in federal jails and prisons, who make up less than <a href=# rel=noopener>10% </a>of the nation’s 173,000 women behind bars. Those in state prisons are dependent on state laws. Over <a href=# rel=noopener>35 s</a><a href=# rel=noopener>tates</a> currently lack menstrual care protections, leaving women incarcerated in those state prisons at the mercy (or cruelty) of their jailers. The voices in this article come from people incarcerated in states without legal menstrual care protections.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In some states, the indifference and the indignities around reproductive health extend from the monthly experience of periods all the way to birth. In <a href=# rel=noopener>Arizona</a>, prisons have induced women into early labor against their will. Between 2005 and 2013, California sterilized over <a href=# rel=noopener>850 people</a> in women’s prisons, frequently without their knowledge or informed consent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No matter what you believe about serving time, we need to question why we permit this kind of control and abuse over anyone’s most basic bodily functions and needs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What’s needed as part of the push for state-level regulations that guarantee the access to menstrual care products (and that the federal government has already acknowledged are necessary), is for us to first open our eyes. We must let the inhumane conditions of bleeding behind bars be known. Menstruation has been taboo for so long that the topic has remained in the shadows. But we are in a new era; we are ready to speak up. Perhaps on the deepest level, the inhumane conditions of bleeding behind bars provokes the question: Why are we locking up so many people in these torturous institutions in the first place—and how does subjecting people to abuse make anyone safer?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamZqg3Z%2Fjqmpoqufo3qusc2sq6utkam2sLqMqaynoaOduqa602g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-made-juneteenth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Juneteenth Honors Black Americans Who Created Their Freedom</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-ancient-people-survived-a-volcanic-winter-816081.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Ancient People Survived a Volcanic Winter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
