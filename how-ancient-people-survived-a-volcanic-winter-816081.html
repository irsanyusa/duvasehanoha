It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;eruption of&nbsp;a&nbsp;supervolcano on&nbsp;Mount Toba. It&nbsp;was also the biggest eruption on&nbsp;Earth over the last 2&nbsp;million years. Even the tragedy of&nbsp;Pompeii, when the volcano Vesuvius destroyed the entire city, was not so&nbsp;large-scale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/6b3/b51/9ffa315f9f80563563e74e93c8.jpeg><p>At&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the Toba eruption, humanity was as&nbsp;close to&nbsp;extinction as&nbsp;ever. And the problem wasn’t in&nbsp;the volcano itself, but in&nbsp;the consequences that came after. Some studies suggest that 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;10&nbsp;thousand people could survive the period after the eruption. During the disaster, Toba released millions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;volcanic ash and soot. This cloud spread across the sky blocking the Sun in&nbsp;India, Indonesia, and over the Indian Ocean.</p><p>Some scientists claimed the world had been plunged into volcanic winter for several decades. Take a&nbsp;look out the window in&nbsp;cloudy weather. Do&nbsp;you see how gray clouds cover the sky? But still, clouds let the sunlight pass through. It&nbsp;was much worse during the Toba eruption since sulfur dioxide in&nbsp;the volcanic ash reflected sunlight.</p><p>Dust and ashes didn’t settle for a&nbsp;long time. Perhaps, they flew all over the planet destroying many living things. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;plants couldn’t survive because of&nbsp;the lack of&nbsp;sunlight. Also, Earth’s temperature dropped by&nbsp;several degrees, which led to&nbsp;new disasters. In&nbsp;today’s modern world, the temperature doesn’t affect residents of&nbsp;our cities that much.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e9b/4f5/f0d87f5794bbc55f7474b6dd4a.jpeg><p>But for <a href=# title=nature data-link=tag>nature</a>, even minor changes may entail catastrophic consequences. For example, plants and insects can live at&nbsp;the same temperature for thousands of&nbsp;years. But a&nbsp;sharp cold snap destroys them. This leads to&nbsp;the fact that almost all animals don’t get enough food to&nbsp;feed their offspring.</p><p>The population of&nbsp;all creatures in&nbsp;the wild is&nbsp;dropping. The ancient people of&nbsp;that time survived by&nbsp;hunting herbivores and gathering berries, fruits, and mushrooms. But the eruption destroyed almost all of&nbsp;it. Also, a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;light caused a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;vitamin D.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, people were starving, and they also were pretty depressed.</p><p>However, some scientists think that many people survived this period quite easily. Especially those who lived on&nbsp;the coast of&nbsp;South Africa. The ocean received the most minor damage from the disaster. And tribes who lived near the water caught a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fish. Both versions haven’t yet been proven. Scientists still try to&nbsp;build an&nbsp;accurate picture of&nbsp;human development after this volcanic apocalypse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/564/398/b29bbc5223ae6caf1a25de6d95.jpeg><p>About&nbsp;50,000 years after the Toba eruption, when the Sun had finally passed through the gray clouds, and the ash settled on&nbsp;the ground, nature and people began to&nbsp;restore the previous balance. But the warm times quickly didn’t start as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>the Ice Age</u></a> had already begun.</p><p>And this problem was much more severe, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;lasted for thousands of&nbsp;years. Decreased solar activity and planet orbit changes led to&nbsp;strong temperature drops. Eternal cold covered almost the globe, forcing all living beings to&nbsp;migrate and struggle for survival.</p><p>Such powerful animals as&nbsp;mammoths and saber-toothed tigers couldn’t survive the ice age. But Homo Sapiens was able to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;the new weather conditions. People hid in&nbsp;caves, made fires, and improved their hunting skills. Therefore, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sense, the ice age made humanity stronger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/92e/c32/5f41de5dd5a2998b84367d2899.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;the modern world, such weather can cause significant problems for the global economy and create financial crises worldwide. The last period similar to&nbsp;the Ice Age happened at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 19th century. Mount Tambora in&nbsp;Indonesia exploded and released millions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;pumice, soot, and volcanic ash into the sky.</p><p>People who lived on&nbsp;a&nbsp;volcanic island got the most severe damage in&nbsp;the first few minutes. But then, the eruption’s consequences began to&nbsp;reach the whole world. Volcanic ash again blocked sunlight and led to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the coldest years in&nbsp;North America and Eurasia.</p><p>This year, 1816, is&nbsp;better known in&nbsp;history as&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>“year without summer.”</u></a> The ash cloud increased humidity and lowered the temperature in&nbsp;many areas. In&nbsp;the summer of&nbsp;1816, in&nbsp;Central and Western Europe and North America, a&nbsp;humid climate and cold destroyed the harvest. Prices for goods rose, and poor people lost access to&nbsp;food. Logistics and transport also suffered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/4e0/219/248dee5eba96065fe15f09d7cf.jpeg><p>People used horses to&nbsp;move around at&nbsp;that time. And since oats also became expensive, many couldn’t afford to&nbsp;keep these animals. Many believe these circumstances inspired the inventor Karl Drais to&nbsp;create the world’s first bicycle.</p><p>Also, there’s a&nbsp;theory that the Tambora eruption helped invent Frankenstein. Several writers, including Byron and Shelley, gathered in&nbsp;a&nbsp;villa in&nbsp;Switzerland, where they began to&nbsp;write fantastic stories. Bad weather and rain outside the window inspired Mary Shelley to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;story about Dr. Frankenstein and his monster. Even now, this volcano is&nbsp;active, but it’s not going to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>But if&nbsp;it&nbsp;happens again, will we&nbsp;be&nbsp;ready this time? Most likely, there will be&nbsp;fewer consequences since we&nbsp;have technologies, big incubators, and greenhouses where we&nbsp;grow livestock, vegetables, and fruits. Of&nbsp;course, winter will provoke a&nbsp;crisis all year round, but we&nbsp;can easily survive&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c47/0eb/96df3f59a497e37ad2929c0924.jpeg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>In&nbsp;the 1930s, another disaster occurred</u>.</a> But this time, it&nbsp;was caused not only by&nbsp;nature but also by&nbsp;people. At&nbsp;that time, many countries were heavily dependent on&nbsp;crops. Vast territories were sown with them. People were engaged in&nbsp;excessive farming. Therefore, when a&nbsp;severe drought began, the soil was quickly depleted. The ground ran out of&nbsp;nutrients necessary for the growth of&nbsp;wheat and corn.</p><p>This led to&nbsp;the fact that the top layer of&nbsp;soil was turned into tiny dust. Then, west-easterly winds hit such states as&nbsp;Colorado, Nebraska, Texas, and Oklahoma. They rose the dust into the air and formed thick clouds. This period is&nbsp;considered the most challenging time of&nbsp;the Great Depression.</p><p>It’s the Dust Bowl. It&nbsp;lasted 8&nbsp;years and forced many people to&nbsp;leave their homes and move to&nbsp;other states. Dust storms got so&nbsp;strong that they blocked the sun in&nbsp;Washington, DC. Whole cities were covered with rain from sand which caused problems with breathing. Even the captains of&nbsp;ships sailing in&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean reported polluted air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/784/0fc/b9c4dc57a1968e200a46601474.jpeg><p>Powerful earthquakes, supervolcano eruptions, floods, fires, and hurricanes&nbsp;— swept whole species of&nbsp;animals off the planet. But a&nbsp;human has always survived in&nbsp;the most challenging conditions. So&nbsp;don’t worry about the next global catastrophe. People will handle it...we hope&nbsp;so.</p><p>But what if&nbsp;some global catastrophe happens, for example, a&nbsp;huge meteorite falls, or&nbsp;the atmosphere gets poisoned? In&nbsp;this case, it’d be&nbsp;best to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;remote island. Or&nbsp;fly to&nbsp;the Moon. The main thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;have the opportunity to&nbsp;return. After all, sooner or&nbsp;later, the apocalypse ends, and Earth will be&nbsp;as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;new, probably.</p><p>Another option is&nbsp;to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;an&nbsp;underground bunker with large reserves of&nbsp;food and oxygen. About 8&nbsp;billion people are living in&nbsp;the world. For humanity to&nbsp;prosper again after the apocalypse and restore its population, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>100-500 hundred</u></a> will be&nbsp;enough. There have been cases in&nbsp;world history when small tribes numbering a&nbsp;few hundred people have lived for centuries and even millennia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/24b/9af/d88be4564d88421fb443a9a39d.jpeg><p>However, to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, you’d have to&nbsp;leave megacities. Big towns only import food. They are heavily dependent on&nbsp;farm fields and crops. During some global catastrophe, no&nbsp;one would give food to&nbsp;the cities. Hunger would lead to&nbsp;complete chaos.</p><p>To&nbsp;live well, people would need to&nbsp;escape from their towns and repeat the practice of&nbsp;those who lived in&nbsp;the early Neolithic period. It&nbsp;was about 12,000 years ago, just after the end of&nbsp;the last ice age. People at&nbsp;that time lived separately in&nbsp;small villages.</p><p>The population of&nbsp;each of&nbsp;them was from a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hundred to&nbsp;a&nbsp;thousand people. They lived independently, provided food, and made big families. In&nbsp;fact, it’s not such a&nbsp;bad option after the apocalypse&nbsp;— to&nbsp;grow vegetables on&nbsp;a&nbsp;small farm, eat healthy food and enjoy nature.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yapZyhlaPBbrzEqKelnV2owrPCyK%2BcnWWRYsOwuMKapaKbXay2r8DEq2RxaWZlhXJ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prison-menstruation-punishment.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Prisons Use Menstruation as a Form of Punishment</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./film-tv.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Film and TV History on October 16</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
