However, he is believed to be a <a href=#>classical musician</a> who works under an alias that does not let him receive direct credit for his work.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c6096ff9617fee46.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jaden Walton’s biography: age, height, birthday, family, girlfriend</span></p></a><h3>Dating history and family issues</h3><p class=align-left>The musician is believed to be currently single. Due to the fact that he lives his life away from public attention, most of his dating history is not known. There is not much information about his ex-girlfriend, ex-wife, or children.</p><p class=align-left>However, in 1974, he fell in love with a lady named April Sandmayer, and they got engaged three years later. Not long after his dad and stepdad became deceased, he began seeing his mother's therapist.</p><p class=align-left>He later discovered that his mother and the therapist were planning to end his relationship with Sandmayer. The issue eventually resulted in his fiancée calling off the engagement.</p><p class=align-left>The musician moved out of his family's house to win her back, but he could not sway her. In 1978, Chris completely gave up his family's fame and money. He left New York and told his family that he would never return.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a0a3ca1f0ef7a5bd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Asaad Amin’s biography: what is known about Muhammad Ali’s son?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He did not contact his family for decades until 2016, when he reconnected with them through Sandmayer.

She left her remaining estate, valued at a little less than $1.5 million, to Anderson.</p><p class=align-left>Christopher, the formerly alienated Anderson Cooper's brother, did not receive anything from his mother because he had been estranged from his relatives for many decades. However, he and his mother did reunite before she died.</p><p class=align-left>At the end of Gloria's life, it was discovered that her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wealth had depleted</a> from an estimated $200 million to $1.5 million.
