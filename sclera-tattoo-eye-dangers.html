Gallinger’s procedure last month went wrong and left <a href=# rel=noopener>purple ink oozing out of her eye</a>, which quickly became swollen, infected and painful.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It hurt. It burned,” Gallinger told TIME on Friday. “At its worst, it’s like having a migraine and then also being punched in the face at the same time. It’s taken a big toll on my mental health.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gallinger said she expects to undergo eye surgery to remove the ink next week, but the vision in her right eye will likely never go back to normal. She’s now speaking out against the dangers of sclera tattoos to spread awareness about the life-changing risks the procedure poses.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what to know about the trend. (Warning: Graphic photo below.)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How do you get a sclera tattoo?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A sclera tattoo is not exactly a tattoo, although it is permanent. It happens when a mixture of ink and saline is injected into the eye through a small needle. The mixture is injected right under the surface of the conjunctiva, which covers the front of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelids, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>American Academy of Ophthalmology</a> (AAO). The most popular color is black, which is perhaps the most shocking, experts say. The procedure is typically done by body modification artists — who focus on altering the human body with procedures that range from piercings to giving a person a forked tongue — rather than tattoo artists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The trend began in Canada about 10 years ago with the first eyeball tattoo experiments. Luna Cobra, the artist who claims to have pioneered the movement, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Newsweek</a> he no longer thinks the procedures are safe. “I’ve been trying to ban this. I think it’s super important that this becomes illegal,” he said. “This is happening all the time, all over the world.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happened to Catt Gallinger?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the time, Gallinger said she had trusted her boyfriend, a body modification artist, to safely complete the procedure. She already has about 25 tattoos on her body, and has undergone another risky procedure to split her tongue to make it appear forked. So Gallinger said getting a sclera tattoo seemed like the next step.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Body modification is something that is growing more popular every day. It’s a big part of my life,” she told TIME. “I have a lot of my friends who have had [sclera tattoos] done and have had it done well. It was something I was interested in.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gallinger said she wanted her sclera dyed purple to contrast with her green eyes. “It’s not that I wanted to stand out to the public, but for me it’s part of expressing who I am,” she said. But Gallinger hadn’t done enough research and gave in too soon to pressure from her boyfriend, she said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the procedure, Gallinger said he made many errors. He did not mix the ink with any saline. He used a large needle instead of a small one, which went too deep into the eye. And instead of doing several small dosages, Gallinger just took one large injection during a 10-minute sitting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That night my eye swelled shut,” she said. “Everyone I knew, they healed within a week maximum. I was going into week three. I was like, ‘This isn’t right.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Finally, Gallinger went to the hospital and she was given antibiotics and steroid eye drops. She now plans to go to police to complain about her former boyfriend, who she said did not warn her about the risks and did not ask her to sign any waivers. “I’m not forgiving him. I won’t be leaving it alone,” she said. “I want him off the streets before he does something worse to someone else.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/catt-gallinger-01.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What do doctors say?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gallinger is at least the second person in Canada to experience adverse effects from an eye tattoo, according to the AAO. Doctors had to remove a man’s eye after an eyeball tattoo left him in pain over the summer. The mixture injected into the 24-year-old patient’s eye was contaminated with bacteria, the AAO said. Two men have also previously presented similar complications from eyeball tattoos, according to the 2017 report in the <a href=# rel=noopener>American Journal of Ophthalmology</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The AAO says serious risks come with eyeball tattoos, which have not been around long enough to be properly studied. (The procedure is also not uniformly regulated.) Those risks include loss of the entire eyeball, decreased vision, complete blindness, infections and sensitivity to light. The professional medical association of ophthalmologists also said artists who do the procedures may not be properly trained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcWZnhXqFjqyapZ2ilnq1rdOtpqhlla6ybrDAp56eqqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1250624-most-expensive-bike-world-2019-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Most expensive bike in the world 2019</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mobilite-des-jeunes-en-territoire-rural-lexemple-dun-village-vosgien.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mobilit des jeunes en territoire rural : l'exemple d'un village vosgien</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
