And I was a one-time mechanic that grew up in the streets of Ojo town.</p><p><strong>Pulse: Tell me about your life as a mechanic?</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Khaid: There was a time my dad needed me to do something as music was not working for me. So I quickly picked mechanic as I could make money from it.</p><p><strong>Pulse: What is the most interesting part of your childhood?</strong></p><p>Khaid: The most interesting part of my childhood is the part where I get to do anything I want. At that time I just lived right. I had no worries of anything not bothered about not being balanced in life.</p><p><strong>Pulse: Does that mean you parents gave you so much freedom while growing up?</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Khaid: No no! Actually my parents were very strict. I had freedom throughout the afternoon when my parents went out. In the morning and evening, I'm this cool kid.</p><p><strong>Pulse: Are you in school?</strong></p><p>Khaid: Yeah! I am in school. Neville records got an academy of their own. I went through that stage and I am kinda going through it.</p><p><strong>Pulse: Let's talk about Neville records. How did you meet Sydney Talker?</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Khaid: He liked one of my freestyles on Instagram, followed and sent me a DM. We linked up, made some cool stuff and he ended up telling me I'm signed.</p><p><strong>Pulse: At what point did you know you had to leave your job as a mechanic?</strong></p><p>Khaid: At the point he told me I was signed. After I met him I was still doing my mechanic. He couldn't see me the first day and tell me to dtop. We had to have a contract and everything before I left.</p><p><strong>Pulse: There are so many careers in life aside music. Why choose music?</strong></p><p>Khaid: It was the freedom to express myself to a larger set of people. Expressing how I feel in music is the reason I chose music.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Pulse: Let's talk about your creative process and your inspiration. What inspires you?</strong></p><p>Khaid:<strong> </strong>I get inspired by literally anything. I could be doing anything, literally anything and I get the vibes.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c80e3992-977e-4202-84c4-ee91df36375b data-caption=Khaid><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/p4fktkpTURBXy85ZmZmZTdjNmVlODI4NDI1YmQ5NjAxZDc2MjgxYTY3OS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNBKHCww></span><p><strong>Pulse: Do you go with the beat before you can write or you write before linking up with a producer?</strong></p><p>Khaid: Sometimes I get beats from producers and sometimes I go online and get the beat, write on it and get the producer to create something original with it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Pulse: What inspired the name of your debut project, 'Diversity'?</strong></p><p>Khaid: We needed a name that describes the richness and diverse nature of the sounds on the project.

I wasn't actually enjoying it except when I get money.</p><p><strong>Pulse: It seems you really love money?</strong></p><p>Khaid: No! (laughs). I am a street guy na.
