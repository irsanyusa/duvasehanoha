The responsible individual was removed from membership on Friday, May 3.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The individual was not named, and the school has also announced a student conduct investigation into one unnamed student.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The university chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) identified the student making the monkey gestures as James “JP” Staples from the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in an <a href=#>Instagram post</a> on Saturday that called for the expulsion of Staples as well as two other students—Connor Moore and Rouse Davis Boyce, both from the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity—that it said were “the primary perpetrators of racist remarks and actions that constitute derogatory and offensive behavior.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In recent weeks, pro-Palestinian protests have <a href=#>spread across U.S. campuses</a>, met with <a href=#>arrests</a> and <a href=#>counterprotests</a>. At Ole Miss, about 30 pro-Palestinian protesters took part in what Gov. Tate Reeves described as a “<a href=#>scheduled</a>” protest, while hundreds of onlookers and counterprotesters taunted them and <a href=#>sang the Star-Spangled Banner</a> to drown out the protesters’ chants.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One protester, identified by the <a href=#>Mississippi Free Press</a> as graduate student Jaylin Smith, was singled out for abuse by counterprotesters, who mocked her weight and lobbed racial abuse at her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Videos of the confrontation at Ole Miss drew reactions from lawmakers who have been vocal in their opposition to pro-Palestinian protests breaking out across American campuses. Republican Rep. Mike Collins appeared to praise the counterprotesters in a <a href=#>post on X</a> that described the viral video as “Ole Miss taking care of business.” Meanwhile, Reeves, also a Republican, shared a separate video of the protesters and counterprotesters on campus, saying that it “warms my heart.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But backlash toward the apparent racism on display also followed. The Ole Miss Associated Student Body—the university’s student government—said in a <a href=#>statement</a> that at the protest, “unacceptable remarks were made that departed from our cherished values.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jacob Batte, the university’s director of news and media relations, similarly told <a href=#>ABC News</a> that “statements were made at the demonstration on our campus Thursday that were offensive and inappropriate,” though he said that they "cannot comment specifically about that video.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chancellor Glenn Boyce wrote in an email to students and staff on Thursday evening that there were no arrests and no reported injuries from the demonstration, which “dispersed without incident.” However, Boyce wrote in a separate <a href=#>email</a> to students on Friday night that “university leaders are aware that some statements made were offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“While student privacy laws prohibit us from commenting on any specific student, we have opened one student conduct investigation. We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Phi Delta Theta and Ole Miss did not respond immediately to TIME’s requests for comment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Boyce referenced Ole Miss’ fraught past—specifically, a history of racism that the school is <a href=#>still grappling with</a>—in his note to university members, saying that “it is important to acknowledge our challenging history, and incidents like this can set us back.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It is one reason why we do not take this lightly,” he said, “and cannot let the unacceptable behavior of a few speak for our institution or define us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWdphniFjq6loq6Vp8CqwNhmpp9lnZ7AtLXSrKCpqJlivbO7056qrWWilrCqv9NmpKimm5rGbrPErKuuqpVis7Ot056pp6Gkrnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-watson-best-red-carpet-looks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>[PHOTOS] Emma Watson's Red Carpet Looks Through the Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mobilite-dialogue-social-grilles-indiciaires-le-point-sur-toutes-les-reformes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>le point sur toutes les rformes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
