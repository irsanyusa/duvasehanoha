This time, though, he says it’s “<a href=# rel=noopener>for good</a>.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After completing his 23rd season, the 45-year-old quarterback marked the end of his career with a short video on social media—and poked fun at his previous false start on retirement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m retiring. For good,” Brady said in the clip. “I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first.” He added: “It won’t be long-winded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay and I used mine up last year.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brady concluded his announcement by thanking his personal and professional supporters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brady departs from the NFL as a seven-time Super Bowl winner with records in passing yards and touchdown passes. He made his Super Bowl debut as a second-year quarterback in 2002 and secured six titles for the New England Patriots. His final Super Bowl ring came with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Feb. 1, 2022—after three seasons with the Buccaneers—Brady first announced his retirement, but he reversed the decision six weeks later citing “unfinished business.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brady’s final year in the sport saw him as the oldest active player in the NFL but his personal performance was still strong. His team finished the season with an 8-9 record and lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the wild-card round of the playoffs. In October, Brady also announced that he and supermodel Gisele Bündchen, whom he was married to for 13 years, had filed for divorce.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While his athletic career may be over, Brady retires to a number of <a href=# rel=noopener>other projects</a> including a 10-year contract with Fox Sports worth $375 million. He also has a clothing brand called BRADY, a wellness brand called TB12 Sports, and his company 199 Productions.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Brady’s supernatural longevity</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With his retirement, Brady leaves the game at 45 and a half years old, more than six years older than the <a href=# rel=noopener>next-oldest NFL starter</a> and the oldest starting quarterback for the seventh season in a row. His consistent greatness and supernatural longevity made him one of the most recognizable figures in the NFL, where he competed for 23 professional seasons even though the average quarterback lasts around four seasons. During that time, he competed in 381 regular season and playoff games, the fourth most in NFL history by any player.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brady credits his lengthy career to what he calls the “TB12 Method,” which emphasizes a stringent diet and workout regimen with an emphasis on stretching and flexibility. In a game where getting sacked and thrown to the ground is the norm, Brady managed to only miss 15 games due to injury.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But all careers have to end at some point, and Brady finishes as the seventh oldest player in NFL history behind George Blanda (48), Morten Anderson (47), Adam Vinatieri (46), John Carney (46), Bobby Marshall (45) and Gary Anderson (45). All of these players were placekickers except for Marshall, who played defensive end for two seasons in the 1920s. In 2021, Brady surpassed Steve DeBerg (44) as the oldest quarterback to start an NFL game.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Among active players, offensive lineman Jason Peters is now the NFL’s oldest player at 41. He becomes an unrestricted free agent in March, and it’s unclear whether he will continue playing. The next oldest players are punter Andy Lee (41), who said last offseason that he was contemplating retirement, and kicker Robbie Gould (40), who recently said that he is “nowhere near retiring.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Below, a short timeline of Brady’s NFL career.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>April 16, 2000:</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brady was drafted by the New England Patriots with the 199th pick in the sixth round, considered one of the greatest draft steals in history.
