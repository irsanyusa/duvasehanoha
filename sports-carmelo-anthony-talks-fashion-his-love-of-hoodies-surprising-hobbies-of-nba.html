He then got traded to the Atlanta Hawks, had his contract bought out, and then signed with the Houston Rockets.</p><p>Now, even with training camps and the NBA season bearing down, Anthony instead has been focused on a collaboration in time for Fashion Week called "Melo Made" between himself, Jordan Brand, and Rag and Bone.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Before the "Melo Made" show in New York City on Thursday, Business Insider was warned Anthony would not be in the mood for talking basketball. Instead, Anthony sat down to talk about his collaboration, fashion, the hobbies of NBA players — and a little bit of basketball.</p><p><strong>Scott Davis: </strong>Can you explain to me your goal with the Melo Made collaboration — what your inspiration was, how you chose the brands, etc?</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>Where does fashion rank for you in your off-court hobbies? I know you have several.</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>What's an essential piece of clothing for a man's closet?</p><p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Gotta have a good pair of jeans, for sure, gotta have a good pair of denim. And you gotta have a nice overcoat. A nice jacket is essential."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>"<a href=# id=11fc6dbc-b4b7-5590-83f6-6109715a0d40>Hoodie Melo</a>" has gotten a lot of attention. If you had to make a new piece of clothing fashionable what would it be?</p><p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Well it would still be a hoodie. You can do so much with hoodies, from fabric to textures. You can just do so much with hoodies.</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>The hoodies aren't even like an ongoing joke or anything, then. You really love them.</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>When you come back to New York, what's your top place for shopping?</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>Who's the best dresser in the NBA?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>You were teammates with Russell Westbrook for a year. What'd you make of his outfits?</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>LeBron James wore that suit with the shorts during the Finals. What'd you make of that? Was it a good look?</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>Maybe? I think he wore it Game 1 of the Finals.</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>Who's the worst dresser in the NBA?</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>Can you call them out?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>Beyond basketball, what would your Rockets team be best at? Like, would it be another sport, would it be best-dressed or something?</p><p><strong>Davis: A</strong>re there any teammates you've had whose off-court interests surprised you?</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>Moving to basketball, you've got a new team, new system — what can you do to fit in with the Rockets?</p><p><strong>Davis: </strong>You've been playing pickup games with a lot of other players. Has anybody stood out to you? Anybody that's impressed you or could be poised for a breakout season?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9Gtqmabkae6prjOZpinrJiku7p505qjpKtdm660tMiopWagmah6rbvVnmSonl2dvLCwyJ6qZqulp72ztdKipaBlmKSvo7XErGSonl2jr6J7kqmcbamibQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-john-noble-make-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does John Noble Make?
