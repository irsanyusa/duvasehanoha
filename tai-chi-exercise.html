Slow, mindful movements. No weights. Low intensity. The practice combines aspects of ancient Chinese medicine, philosophy and martial arts, and it’s the antithesis of most modern exercise programs that emphasize fast, vigorous activity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Indeed, certain parts of tai chi are thousands of years old. But while tai chi may look mundane—even boring to some—experts who’ve studied it say its benefits are vast and hard to oversell.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tai chi is a richly researched exercise, with health improvements ranging from better blood pressure scores to a sharper mind. “We’ve seen improved immunity to viruses and improved vaccine response among people who practiced tai chi,” says Dr. Michael Irwin, a professor of behavioral sciences and director of the Mindful Awareness Research Center at UCLA. During the past 15 years, Irwin has published more than a dozen studies linking tai chi to lower rates of insomnia, depression, illness and inflammation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It holds up when compared to other more strenuous types of exercise. “Over time, we see people who do tai chi achieve similar levels of fitness as those who walk or do other forms of physical therapy,” Irwin says. One <a href=# rel=noopener>study in the American Journal of Epidemiology</a> concluded that tai chi was nearly as effective as jogging at lowering risk of death among men. Another <a href=# rel=noopener>review in PLOS One</a> found that the practice may improve fitness and endurance of the heart and lungs, even for healthy adults.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>How Kickboxing Can Change Your Body and Your Life</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Part of that is due to tai chi’s soothing effects on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which tends to activate when a person is under stress. Much like aerobic exercise, tai chi seems to increase hormone and heart-rate measures linked with lower SNS activity, which could partly explain its ties to stronger hearts and lungs, Irwin says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But how could such low-intensity exercise—something that involves movements with names like “cloud hands” and “lifting a lute”—offer these kinds of fitness perks?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“One of the most striking things we’ve found is that [tai chi’s] physiological impacts can’t be explained by its physical activity component,” Irwin says. It’s the mindful, meditative quality of tai chi that makes it so compelling, and that may explain the practice’s broad benefits.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I think of it as meditation on wheels,” says Dr. Peter Wayne, director of research at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Harvard Medical School. (He’s the author of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Harvard Medical School Guide to Tai Chi</a>, in which he references more than 600 academic papers on the health boons of the practice.) “You’re getting all the cognitive pieces you might get from meditation—mental clarity and focus and positive thoughts and lower stress—but you’re also getting physical exercise.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Why Running Is Such Perfect Cardio</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tai chi may also be a more approachable form of <a href=#>mindfulness training</a> for those who struggle with the sit-and-breathe forms of meditation. “Directing attention to the body and pairing hand movements with balance and flexibility is easier for a lot of people than breath focus,” Irwin says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tai chi may be especially healthful for older or sick adults who can’t perform more vigorous forms of physical activity. Among these groups, the practice is associated with improved balance and mobility, reduced risk of falls and better reaction times, Wayne says. A <a href=# rel=noopener>study in the Journal of Rheumatology</a> tied tai chi to reduced pain and stiffness among people who have arthritis. It may also improve kidney and heart function among people suffering from related health issues, according to another <a href=# rel=noopener>study in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But maybe the most compelling reason to give tai chi a shot is its ability to strengthen the connections between your mind and body, which can help you move through life with greater awareness and pleasure. “You might enjoy exercise more than you did before because you’re more mindful of your body,” Wayne says. “Or you may avoid injury or falls because of body awareness.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s a rare aspect of exercise. Unlike almost every other form of physical activity, tai chi demands focus, which is central to its meditative benefits. “Even with <a href=#>yoga</a>, you can do it and have your mind be somewhere else,” Irwin says. “It’s very hard to do tai chi and not be present.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtb2Vtg3l%2Fjq2YomWTnbZusdeeqZyho5p8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./6-nigerian-artists-blackface-has-accused-of-stealing-his-songs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>6 Nigerian artists Blackface has accused of stealing his songs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mcdonalds-captain-america-brave-new-world-toys-spoilers-1235990226.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Captain America: Brave New World Is the Latest Movie With Tie-In Toys That Reveal Sp</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
