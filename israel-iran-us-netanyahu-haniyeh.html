By deliberately maximizing Tehran’s embarrassment—Haniyeh was <a href=#>killed</a> only hours after the <a href=#>inauguration</a> of Iran’s new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian—the Israeli government also maximized the likelihood of Iranian retaliation. That is—at least <a href=#>in the view</a> of a former Deputy Head of the Israeli National Security Council—because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to <a href=#>spark a larger war</a> and drag the U.S. into it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though Israel itself would pay a high price in a region-wide war, it would serve Netanyahu’s interests in numerous ways.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Firstly, Haniyeh’s assassination <a href=#>kills the prospect</a> of an imminent ceasefire deal. Netanyahu has consistently opposed a deal that would end the war. The<a href=#> Israeli daily Haaretz revealed</a> that, in prior rounds of negotiations, he strategically leaked sensitive information to the media at crucial moments to sabotage talks. As President Biden <a href=#>told</a> TIME when asked whether Netanyahu was prolonging the war for the sake of his political career, “There is every reason to draw that conclusion.” Netanyahu knows that a hostage deal will collapse his government and end his reign as Prime Minister. It would also likely mean the <a href=#>expedition</a> of his <a href=#>ongoing corruption</a> trial, which may very well land him in jail. Nothing kills these talks more effectively than ending the life of the negotiator on the other side of the table.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Secondly, Haniyeh’s killing may corner a future President Kamala Harris. While the Biden Administration has consistently <a href=#>blamed Hamas</a> for the failure to reach a deal, there are signs Harris could take a different approach to Biden’s near-complete deference to Israel. “<a href=#>As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done</a>,” she said after he v<a href=#>isited Washington</a> last week, pinning the blame for the lack of progress at his feet. Her cold body language, her expression of empathy for the suffering of Palestinians, and her willingness to publicly point to Israel’s obfuscation were hard for Netanyahu to miss.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>How Gaza Policy Could Change With Harris</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thirdly, killing Haniyeh also killed another line of potential negotiation: between the U.S. and Iran. The surprise election of Pezeshkian—who campaigned on a platform of <a href=#>restarting talks</a> with the U.S.—created a small window for renewed diplomacy. But the escalation sparked by the assassination has severely undercut Pezeshkian’s prospects of creating political space in Tehran for such an outreach. This is particularly true since Tehran believes that Israel acted with the Biden Administration’s blessing. In a <a href=#>letter to the President of the U.N. Security Council</a>, Iran’s U.N. ambassador wrote that the attack “could not have occurred without the authorization and intelligence support of the United States.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Given Israel’s <a href=#>longstanding opposition</a> to improved U.S.-Iran relations, choosing to assassinate Haniyeh around Pezeshkian’s inauguration is unlikely a coincidence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Indeed, Netanyahu has for <a href=#>two decades</a> sought to get the U.S. to go to war with Iran. The last four American Presidents have all at various times faced pressure from Israel to attack Iran. Though much focus has been on Iran’s nuclear program, the desire for a direct U.S. attack goes <a href=#>deeper than uranium enrichment</a>. Israel sees Iran as threatening a regional arrangement that otherwise provides Israel with maximum maneuverability, including the ability to strike Syria and <a href=#>Lebanon</a> with almost complete impunity. A nuclear deal that prevents Iran from building a bomb would not shift the regional balance away from Iran, the Israelis believe. In fact, through the <a href=#>sanctions relief</a> that Iran was promised under Obama’s nuclear deal, Iran’s conventional capabilities would probably grow. Obama’s rapprochement with Iran <a href=#>edged the regional balance of power</a> away from the Persian Gulf states and Israel. That balance of power cannot be sustained by Israel’s military capacity alone. It requires severe economic sanctions and American military action.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Israel’s apparent attack appears designed to elicit an Iranian response, one that could easily spiral into a larger war that draws in the U.S. In April, the Biden Administration prevented an uncontrollable escalation by helping choreograph an exchange of fire between Iran and Israel following Israel’s bombing of Iran’s consulate in Damascus on April 1. Today the U.S. can still stop the region from descending into chaos, but only if it is willing to put clear and public red lines in front of Netanyahu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBrgnF8jqKqq5mVoXqqvsCnZK6rXaOyta3NspihrV2drq%2B12J6faA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-the-holidays-dont-make-everyone-feel-so-jolly.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why the Holidays Dont Make Everyone Feel So Jolly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./financement-des-lieux-de-culte-sept-propositions-pour-un-cadre-plus-clair-et-securise.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>sept propositions pour un cadre plus clair et scuris</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
