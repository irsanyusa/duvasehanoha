As with the previous MCU movie, September’s <a href=#><i>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</i></a>, <i>Eternals</i> focuses on heroes who haven’t been a part of the film universe until now, and as such, casual moviegoers might not know who the titular Eternals are. (Heck, the average comics reader might not be super familiar with them.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In preparation for <i>Eternals</i>’ Nov. 5 premiere, here’s everything you need to know about the Eternals and how these characters will fit into the MCU.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>A cosmic comics history</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SLH-02817_RC.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Eternals—a group of immortal beings tasked with protecting and nurturing the human race—were created by the legendary comics writer and artist <a href=#>Jack Kirby</a> in 1976. Kirby, who co-created <a href=#>Captain America</a>, <a href=#>The Fantastic Four</a> and many more iconic characters, left Marvel Comics for rival <a href=#>DC Comics</a> in 1970. While there, he created the New Gods, a cosmic, high-concept series of characters who count the <a href=#>Justice League</a> baddie <a href=#>Darkseid</a> among their ranks. When Kirby returned to Marvel five years later, he still wanted to explore some of the mythical sci-fi ideas he had embraced with DC’s New Gods. This desire yielded <i>The Eternals </i>#1, which hit shelves in July of 1976.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In this original comic, the Eternals were a type of near-immortal, humanlike being with diverse powers who were created by Celestials, extremely powerful, beyond ancient beings. The Celestials experimented on what would become humanity ages ago, seeding the ability for normal humans to develop mutations (<i>à la</i> the X-Men) or other superpowers and also creating an evil sort of being alongside the Eternals: The Deviants. It was the Eternals’ mission to defend humanity from the Deviants.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are a lot of Eternals in the comics—more than feature in the movie—and many of them, like Ikarus, Sersi, and Thena (who are played in the film by Richard Madden, Gemma Chan and Angelina Jolie, respectively) have names that resemble gods or other characters from Greek mythology. These naming similarities are explained due to the Eternals’ god-like status and presence throughout prehistory, as they were mistaken for Greek gods or otherwise inspired mythic characters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The specifics of the Eternals’ story has changed and been made more complex over the decades, and the MCU version isn’t necessarily exactly like Kirby’s original pitch (there’s no evidence yet that Celestials are going to be the ones introducing Mutants to the MCU), but the general gist is the same. The Eternals have appeared throughout the years in several different Marvel comic series, starring in several of their own and making appearances in other comics or big crossover events. A new, ongoing <i>Eternals </i>comic began this January to general critical acclaim, but the Zhao-directed movie is by far their most high-profile appearance.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>How do the Eternals fit into the MCU?</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SLH-04207_R.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the trailers and the very proper noun-heavy opening text for the film reveal, the Eternals have roughly the same origin in the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> as they do in the comics. They were created by Celestials to defend humanity from the Deviants and help the species grow and develop.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While neither the Eternals nor the Deviants have appeared in the MCU before, we have seen quite a bit of the Celestials. In <a href=#><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i></a>, we see footage of a towering Celestial wielding an <a href=#>Infinity Stone</a>, and the space mining colony the Guardians visit, called Knowhere, is built in the severed head of a dead Celestial. In <a href=#><i>Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2</i></a><i>, </i>we learn that Ego the Living Planet (Kurt Russell) is a Celestial and that Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) is half-Celestial by extension. (However, Ego is just your average sentient planet in the comics and not a Celestial, and perhaps as a result, the movie version looks and acts a little bit different from most of the other Celestials in the MCU.) In any case, <i>Eternals</i> will explain what the Celestials’ whole deal is as a nigh-omnipotent race of giant cosmic space aliens in a way that earlier MCU films only touched on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MES7050_comp_v151.1034_R2_COMP.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the continuity of the MCU, the Eternals have been on Earth since the Stone Age. Somebody who has watched the 25 movies prior to <i>Eternals</i> might reasonably ask, “Where the hell have they been?” Indeed, in the movie, Dane Whiteman (a regular human played by <i>Game of Thrones </i>star <a href=#>Kit Harington</a>) even asks Sersi why the Eternals didn’t intervene when <a href=#>Thanos</a> (Josh Brolin) destroyed half of all life in the galaxy. The answer? The Eternals were instructed by the Celestials not to interfere with any human conflict unless it involved the Deviants. As a result, they stood idly by during the Infinity War, the events of <i>Age of Ultron</i>, <a href=#><i>Doctor Strange</i></a>, <i>Thor 2: The Dark World,</i> and any number of other potentially world-ending incidents where you’d think it would’ve made sense for the Eternals to lift a finger.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Eternals’ non-intervention mandate—which is more of a movie thing than a comics one—is convenient. The real reason why the Eternals didn’t help in any of the earlier movies is because Marvel Studios hadn’t made <i>Eternals</i> and so they hadn’t been cast and functionally didn’t exist in the fiction. Plus, even when reading comics, you kind of need to just willingly allow for unnecessary crossovers. (Why doesn’t Superman simply help <a href=#>Batman</a> catch the <a href=#>Joker</a> as it would be easy for him to do so? Because this is a Batman story, and if Superman showed up and solved every problem then there wouldn’t be any story at all.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, once you just accept that the Eternals simply didn’t help in any earlier instance in the MCU despite being there the whole time, the movie works just fine. In a way, it’s one of the easier movies for an MCU newbie to go into, as other than some one-off lines of dialogue and asides, there really isn’t any MCU backstory the average viewer will need to know about. <i>Eternals</i> largely stands alone—its narrative spans millennia and contains a rich history, just one that doesn’t really retread any of the ground the preview MCU films had already covered.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While <i>Eternals</i> doesn’t have many ties to the MCU’s past, it does set up what’s coming next in the franchise in some big ways. To say more ahead of its release would be a spoiler, however.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Who are the Eternals?</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SLH-24202_RC.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Having established the Eternals’ comic history and how that’s been adapted to fit in the MCU, it’s worth spending a little time introducing the actual individual Eternals—though perhaps not too much time, as the point of the movie is letting the audience learn who these characters are.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sersi (Gemma Chan) is the ostensible protagonist of <i>Eternals</i>, even with its ensemble cast. Chan, who had a small role as a side villain in <i>Captain Marvel</i>, returns to the MCU as an entirely unrelated character. All the Eternals have a specific superpower, and Sersi’s is the ability to manipulate molecules and atoms, transforming inanimate objects into other materials with a touch. In the past, Sersi was in a relationship with the most powerful Eternal, Ikarus (<a href=#>Richard Madden</a>), who has the ability to fly and shoot laser beams out of his eyes, just like Superman.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Eternals are led by Ajak (<a href=#>Salma Hayek</a>). Ajak is one of a handful of characters whose gender and/or race were changed from the original comics, where most of the Eternals were white guys. She has the power to heal, and she’s the one who communicates with their Celestial master.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BGN1380_comp_v003_066792.1039.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other Eternals include Kingo (<a href=#>Kumail Nanjiani</a>), a charming, somewhat swashbuckling Eternal who can fire energy blasts from his hands, finger-guns style. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is incredibly inventive, able to create advanced technology, some of which he gifts to the nascent human race to aid in their development. Sprite (Lia McHugh) can create complex, life-like illusions. She is unique among the Eternals because she has the appearance of a child, though seeing as she’s an immortal being, she never physically ages or grows up. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) has super-speed and is deaf, as is the actor who plays her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Druig (Barry Keoghan) can control people’s minds while Gilgamesh (Don Lee) has incredibly super-powered punches. Finally, there’s Thena (<a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>), a gifted warrior who can create any weapon she needs at any given time out of cosmic energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HIR1107_comp_v004.1040.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harington’s character, Dane Whiteman, is a normal human whom Sersi is dating when the movie begins, but savvy comics readers have noted that he shares his name with the Marvel hero Black Knight, an observation that could bear hints as to his future in the MCU.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s a lot of new characters all at once, along with a lot of new concepts that push the MCU in a new direction. Perhaps that’s why <i>Eternals</i> is 2 hours and 37 minutes long—ample time to give the audience a good sense of who these characters are and what their place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be going forward.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">James Grebey is an entertainment journalist who edits features for SYFY WIRE, writes on occasion for Vulture, Polygon, GQ, Decider and more, and tweets dumb photoshopped jokes on Twitter, where he’s <a href=# rel=noopener>@jgrebes</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWFnhXF8jq2fnmWVqbKzusClqmalkafDpriMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yoruba-nollywood-actor-sisi-quadri-has-died-at-44.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yoruba Nollywood actor Sisi Quadri has died at 44</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./march.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened on March 8, 1955</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
