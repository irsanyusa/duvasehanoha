While this is far from mass adoption, it’s not insignificant.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Plus, several other signs suggest a legitimate market for dumb phones and other low-tech offerings could take shape in the near future, the most prominent of which being that these products are already piquing the interest of sizable shares of young people — namely Gen Z adults and millennials — who are increasingly concerned about their digital habits.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Young and dumb(phone)</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">16% of Gen Z adults say they currently own a dumb phone, the highest of any generation. They are also most likely to know someone outside of their household who owns a dumb phone (14%). Millennials are the next closest on both metrics.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Top reasons for dumb phone ownership among all U.S. adults include a desire for a simplified phone experience (without apps and other bells and whistles) and a desire to limit screen time.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Another oft-cited motivation for those who have already acquired dumb phones, however, is an appreciation for nostalgia.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">With today’s young people being <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>well-documented lovers</a> of retro styles and sensibilities, this sentiment is undoubtedly contributing to their outsized general curiosity about dumb phones, too: The shares of Gen Z adults (28%) and millennials (26%) who report interest in acquiring a dumb phone are more than double that of their Gen X (13%) and baby boomer peers (9%).</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Of course, aesthetics are not the only factor at play. The primary driver of young consumers’ interest in dumb phone ownership is most likely their perceived excessive screen time.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Majorities of Gen Z adults (64%) and millennials (52%) said they typically spend 5 or more hours on their smartphones per day — an amount of time which majorities of each group also described as “too much.” Meanwhile, most members of the general population and older generations said they use their smartphones “the right amount.”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In a follow-up question to those who said they spend too much time on their smartphones about why they think their screen time is a problem, a desire to be more present in daily life and have more time for hobbies were frequently selected answers by Gen Zers and millennials, as were negative impacts on sleep and mental health.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Ultimately, it’s unlikely that dumb phones ever become fully mainstream — after all, the shares of every major cohort who aren’t interested in such devices are bigger than the shares who are. But it’s clear that phone fatigue, and technology fatigue more broadly, is an ailment impacting young people disproportionately. And companies that can address this — whether directly or indirectly — are poised to earn some serious goodwill (and dollars) from these consumers moving forward.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Dumb technology, smart decision?</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While most technology brands seem content with pushing <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>artificial intelligence features</a> into seemingly every product at the moment, a few are finding under-the-radar success with a less flashy approach.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Dumb technology providers Punkt and Light Phone have seen <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>demand surge</a> within the last year. Nokia and Consumer Cellular each recently rolled out new dumb phones, too — the latter doing so via a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>well-received</a> campaign spoofing Apple’s “Shot on iPhone” ads.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But with more than 2 in 5 Gen Z adults (42%) and millennials (42%) — and over a third of all U.S. adults (34%) — reporting interest in a low-tech lifestyle, the opportunities to activate around the idea of unplugging aren’t limited to just the technology sector.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That said, non-tech brands’ early attempts at this&nbsp; have focused on buzz-generating giveaways.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In April, Heineken teamed up with clothing retailer Bodega to make a limited-edition branded dumb phone available through enter-to-win competitions. The ad agency behind the effort <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>told</a> Fast Company that the idea was to encourage consumers to “make space for [their] social life.”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Icelandic yogurt brand Siggi’s recently employed a similar tactic, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>offering $10,000</a> to a select group of customers who were willing to go a month without their smartphones.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">However, the format could mature in time.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">One possible manifestation of this could be a boom in companies hosting hyperlocal, in-person events centered around <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>small moments of digital detox</a>, such as community walks and runs — especially as <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Americans continue to get sportier</a></p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Another possibility is the resurrection of brands closely associated with that sweet spot of early 2000s-early cell phone life, when it was a tool that enabled everyday conveniences and building community without being the burden that it can be now. (Limited Too is <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>leading the way</a> here). We may also see a wave of companies using retro technologies <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>as inspiration</a> for new products and styles in a manner similar to what is currently happening with <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>food and fashion</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>A market, not a movement</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It’s far-fetched to think that consumers, even those disillusioned with their present relationship to technology, will ever turn away from smartphones and other advanced devices en masse. But that doesn’t mean a viable market for throwback products, experiences and aesthetics can’t simultaneously exist — something that will become even more apparent as young people enter parenthood in larger numbers.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Gen Z adults and millennials’ experience with technology overconsumption will <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>assuredly inform</a> the digital habits of future generations.s.
