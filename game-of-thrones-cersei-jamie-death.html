After being mortally wounded in his winning fight against Euron Greyjoy, the Kingslayer was desperate to reunite with his sister one last time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Lannister twins then died together as the Red Keep crumbled around them, something that George R. R. Martin has frequently hinted would happen in his A Song of Ice and Fire series. In the <a href=#>books that Game of Thrones is based on</a>, Jaime and Cersei have both directly stated that they believe they will die together, just as they were born together.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I cannot die while Cersei lives,” Jaime thinks in A Storm of Swords. “We will die together as were born together.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If he were dead, I would know it,” Cersei tells <a href=# rel=noopener>Kevan Lannister</a> in A Dance With Dragons. “We came into this world together, Uncle. He would not go without me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/game-of-thrones-s8-e5-cersei-jaime.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cersei also makes a similar to statement to Ned Stark in season 1 of Game of Thrones. “Jaime and I are more than brother and sister; we shared a womb, came into this world together — we belong together.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many fans believed that Jaime would be the one to take Cersei out, whether it was a mercy killing or simply a way to end the madness that surrounded her chaotic reign and their doomed relationship. However it was ultimately the castle collapsing around them that killed them both.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The belief that <a href=#>Jaime would kill Cersei</a> largely stemmed from the <a href=# rel=noopener>flashback</a> in season 5 in which a young Cersei has her future told by a witch named Maggy the Frog. “You will never wed the prince, you will wed the king,” Maggy tells her. “You’ll be queen, for a time. Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all you hold dear…The king will have 20 children, and you will have three…Gold will be their crowns, gold their shrouds.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-s5-e1-maggy-the-frog.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By the time that season 8 rolled around, all of these predictions had already come true. Cersei was promised to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen as a young girl, but ended up marrying King Robert Baratheon following <a href=#>Robert’s Rebellion</a>. During their marriage, he fathered many illegitimate children while Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen — who are all dead — were a product of Cersei’s incestuous relationship with Jaime. As for the younger queen, both Margaery Tyrell and Daenerys could arguably fill that role.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, in Martin’s books, there is a cryptic final line to the prophecy that the show left out: “And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since “valonqar” means “little brother” in High Valyrian, in the books, Cersei long assumes that Maggy was talking about <a href=#>Tyrion</a>. However, because Jaime is the second-born twin and, therefore, also her little brother, many fans thought that Jaime would turn out to be the one who does the deed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, it turns out the show didn’t just scrap that line out to not give away what was coming. It wasn’t Jaime or Tyrion who killed Cersei in the end, but her own destructive decisions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWhrhHV%2FjqCYpp1dpLNuwMerpqedo2Kwpr7SnqBmopGitqZ5w56YraBf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./husband-material.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Husband material | Pulse Nigeria</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./4031-favourite-olympic-sports.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Favourite Olympic sports | YouGov</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
