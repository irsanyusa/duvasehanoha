Okay, but when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;construction stuff, it’s best to&nbsp;avoid them altogether. Not only they can be&nbsp;perilous, but quite pricey too! Like Tacoma Narrows Bridge in&nbsp;Washington.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b30/f88/44ab595124984dfeacd20f3719.png><p>The construction works were finished in&nbsp;1940, a&nbsp;twin suspension bridge was unique and one-of-the-kind construction never seen before. In&nbsp;today’s equivalent, it&nbsp;costs about 1&nbsp;billion bucks. Still, despite the amount of&nbsp;money spent, the bridge lasted slightly over 4&nbsp;months. The engineers apparently missed one highly important issue&nbsp;— the wind. So, the bridge would sway and buckle&nbsp;— and that was probably because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new construction method never used before.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, the workers did notice something went wrong before the construction was finished, but they didn’t really pay attention to&nbsp;it&nbsp;and continued their work as&nbsp;if&nbsp;nothing had happened. They even nicknamed it&nbsp;“Galloping Gertie”. One day, the wiggly bridge rolled and rolled and collapsed, and millions of&nbsp;dollars spent ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the river. Good news&nbsp;— nobody got injured there!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/41d/acf/4f5199596298b0a51ee7709870.png><p>The next one on&nbsp;the list is&nbsp;the Aon Center, one of&nbsp;the tallest buildings in&nbsp;Chicago today. Chicago is&nbsp;famous for hosting the first skyscraper ever, but the Aon Center has had bad luck. It&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;architectural masterpiece covered with exquisite Carrara marble from Tuscany. Bello! Yeah, it&nbsp;was incredible when it&nbsp;was just built, but it&nbsp;turned out the marble chunks weren’t thick enough, and soon after the Aon Center started sort of&nbsp;peeling, just like you peel a&nbsp;hard-boiled egg.</p><p>You can still find this building at&nbsp;the very same place where it&nbsp;was constructed, but it&nbsp;looks somewhat different from the original version. There has been a&nbsp;huge makeover in&nbsp;the 90s, and now there’s granite instead of&nbsp;marble. Not bad! Still, the repairs cost 80&nbsp;million dollars. This does sound like a&nbsp;huge construction mistake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b92/407/a06b3d525ba3c950e2e3cb8e86.png><p>Welp, the Aon Center may have looked like an&nbsp;egg for some time, but there’s another building with a&nbsp;construction mistake that made people feel like an&nbsp;egg on&nbsp;a&nbsp;frying pan. The Walkie-Talkie structure in&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a> cost over 200 million pounds but guess what? There’s been a&nbsp;terrible engineering mistake. The glass facade had a&nbsp;peculiar shape as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was curved and that was the problem, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;acted like a&nbsp;giant concave mirror that reflected and focused the light.</p><p>Remember what a&nbsp;magnifying glass can do&nbsp;to&nbsp;the leaves if&nbsp;you catch the sunray? This comparison can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;an&nbsp;exaggeration, but people inside the Walkie-Talkie claim it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;fun inside with a&nbsp;scorching temperature of&nbsp;above 160&nbsp;F and charred carpets! They say the reflecting rays could even melt the cars parked nearby. The issue was solved thanks to&nbsp;an&nbsp;enormous sunscreen placed across the facade, which cost extra 10&nbsp;million pounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8b9/9fb/65bb6e5089b0cd6127e1664524.png><p>Picture this: you want to&nbsp;relax a&nbsp;bit in&nbsp;Las Vegas, and you book a&nbsp;room in&nbsp;a&nbsp;luxurious 55-story hotel. There’s a&nbsp;Spa too! You know that the whole building is&nbsp;worth 8.5 billion dollars, and you’re sure nothing can go&nbsp;wrong. Ever... In&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;can.</p><p>This is&nbsp;Vdara spa and hotel, and it&nbsp;has the same flaw the Walkie-Talkie in&nbsp;London has. For an&nbsp;hour and a&nbsp;half at&nbsp;midday, an&nbsp;intense concentration of&nbsp;scorching light from the main glass building reflects the sun rays onto a&nbsp;single point in&nbsp;the pool area. And this ray is&nbsp;so&nbsp;hot it&nbsp;can singe hair and melt plastic.</p><p>Yeah, I&nbsp;know there are places on&nbsp;Earth where hairdressers trim their clients’ hair with fire, but in&nbsp;this case, it’s not a&nbsp;beauty service, but a&nbsp;construction blunder. The curved glass surface acts as&nbsp;a&nbsp;parabolic reflector dish. Again, it’s the same magnifying glass trick, but imagine the sun’s rays going through a&nbsp;55-story magnifying glass, woo-hoo!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7f7/8a6/520d8e5d5581f4d96beff89c5c.png><p>Many stunning buildings have secrets or&nbsp;even construction mistakes behind them. The Sydney Opera House is&nbsp;no&nbsp;exception! It’s hard to&nbsp;believe that listening to&nbsp;the greatest operas of&nbsp;all time there, but the first people who spotted the mistake were the musicians. Thing&nbsp;is, they couldn’t actually hear their own music because of&nbsp;the acoustical imperfections. So, it&nbsp;cost 300 million Australian dollars to&nbsp;fix the issue.</p><p>Now imagine you’ve paid 300 million dollars for a&nbsp;building, but in&nbsp;the end, you got leaks, cracks, and drainage problems. The Massachusetts Institute of&nbsp;Technology doesn’t even have to&nbsp;imagine&nbsp;it, cause this situation did happen to&nbsp;them. An&nbsp;architect together with a&nbsp;construction company created Stata Center. Usually, the MIT buildings are referred to&nbsp;by&nbsp;their numbers, but Stata Center is&nbsp;an&nbsp;exception.</p><p>In&nbsp;1998, Building 20&nbsp;was demolished leaving behind only the time capsule to&nbsp;be&nbsp;opened in&nbsp;2053. To&nbsp;replace&nbsp;it, Stata Center aka Building 32&nbsp;was built. The design is&nbsp;quaint, and it&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;dancing robots. It&nbsp;got a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;architectural criticism too&nbsp;— some people even describe it&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;unfinished building about to&nbsp;collapse. The architect’s firm claimed the construction problems were inevitable, but they still had to&nbsp;pay 15&nbsp;million dollars to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;for the problems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3c3/c50/112315545ea57d31033d0d6eb0.png><p>Back in&nbsp;1971, in&nbsp;Boston, The Hancock skyscraper was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;built, but it&nbsp;was delayed by&nbsp;5&nbsp;years. The initial price was about 75&nbsp;million dollars, but in&nbsp;the process of&nbsp;construction, it&nbsp;required more money, so&nbsp;the final initial price is&nbsp;175 million dollars, which roughly equals 850 million today dollars.</p><p>The problems started during the excavation process&nbsp;— the temporary retaining walls didn’t turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;strong enough to&nbsp;hold back clay and mud, so&nbsp;they kind of&nbsp;warped. It’s like when you stack playing cards&nbsp;— you shift one in&nbsp;the foundation, and the whole stack falls apart.</p><p>The same happens when the soil shifts, which happened when building the Hancock. The pavements and the nearby buildings got cracked too, and the utility lines got damaged as&nbsp;well! Those damages cost at&nbsp;least 11&nbsp;million dollars back in&nbsp;1976, as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the damaged nearby buildings won a&nbsp;lawsuit. Today’s equivalent of&nbsp;the first mistake is&nbsp;about 53&nbsp;million dollars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c99/efc/79ae1c5d51b65129058fe11f2d.png><p>Another trouble is&nbsp;the blue reflective glass covering the skyscraper. You may think it&nbsp;acted as&nbsp;a&nbsp;magnifying glass again, but nope! Those glass panels would constantly detach and crash down on&nbsp;the sidewalk. The stronger the wind was, the higher the chances were that those panels would start falling down, so&nbsp;the police closed the nearby pedestrian streets once the wind reached 45&nbsp;mph.</p><p>In&nbsp;the end, all the 10,344 panels were replaced&nbsp;— there was no&nbsp;other way out. Eventually, all of&nbsp;them would have crashed down due to&nbsp;the thermal stress caused by&nbsp;air expansion and contraction. It&nbsp;required an&nbsp;extra 5&nbsp;to&nbsp;7&nbsp;million dollars back then to&nbsp;refurbish the building, which equals around 44&nbsp;million in&nbsp;today’s dollars.</p><p>One more problem yet again&nbsp;— we&nbsp;all know the skyscrapers tend to&nbsp;sway a&nbsp;bit, right? Those sways usually come unnoticed, but not for the Hancock. People who lived on&nbsp;the upper floors started having motion sickness, so&nbsp;the right thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was to&nbsp;install a&nbsp;mass damper to&nbsp;minimize vibrations. Another 3&nbsp;million dollars back then translated into 18.6 million dollars today. In&nbsp;total, 966 million today’s dollars were spent on&nbsp;the Hancock. Almost a&nbsp;one-billion-dollar disaster!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1ed/2d6/6df2565c90948be1a38e898adc.png><p>The last but not the least is&nbsp;the Leaning Tower of&nbsp;Pisa. That’s the kind of&nbsp;construction mistakes&nbsp;I like&nbsp;— despite its bizarre tilt, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best-loved Italian landmarks. The reason for the tilt is&nbsp;simple&nbsp;— the soil on&nbsp;the construction site was too soft to&nbsp;handle such a&nbsp;massive construction, and this is&nbsp;why the tower’s foundations are kind of&nbsp;destabilized.</p><p>The historians claim it&nbsp;was clear the tower would lean when the builders got to&nbsp;the third story, but they didn’t pay much attention to&nbsp;it&nbsp;and continued their work. Fun fact: the tower doesn’t lean, it&nbsp;actually falls --- very slowly.</p><p>So, it’s been falling since 1178, and each year it&nbsp;gets one to&nbsp;two millimeters closer to&nbsp;the ground. Still, in&nbsp;this list, this construction mistake is&nbsp;the only one that didn’t require any extra money but vice versa brought a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;extra money thanks to&nbsp;the countless tourists who come to&nbsp;see it&nbsp;each day.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIVuuc6sq2adqKWyr7%2FIr5xmnZ6ctq%2BxxKugp59dora0wMCknKxlpJ2ybsPOq6OdZZiWwG6%2FxJ6lZnBhaoN0fo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./airport-delays-tsa.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Airport Delays: Ranking Longest Security Waits in U.S.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1559273-funny-big-forehead-jokes-roasts-friends.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>50+ funny big forehead jokes and roasts to tell your friends</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
