Zúñiga was seen being arrested by police.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bolivia-demonstrators.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what to know about Zúñiga, his apparent motivations, and what will happen to him now after his failed coup.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who is Bolivia’s coup attempt leader Zúñiga?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Juan José Zúñiga Macías, a career military officer with a controversial past, was appointed general commander of the Bolivian Army by President Arce in November 2022 and was retained in his position this January when other commanders were shuffled by Arce.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But while Zúñiga had previously held high ranks including brigadier general and chief of the general staff, he was most renowned for his military intelligence skills, according to Bolivian news site <a href=#>Urgente.bo</a>. According to Bolivian paper <a href=#>el Deber</a>, Zúñiga also cultivated a reputation as “the people’s general” by forming close ties with social movements and unions such as mine workers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Zúñiga has also faced accusations of wrongdoing long before his coup attempt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/zuniga-tank-bolivia-coup.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An official military report in 2013 said Zúñiga, then head of an infantry regiment, embezzled 2.7 million bolivianos (about $400,000) from public funds intended for pensions, school vouchers, and military travel expenses. He and seven others linked to the scheme were jailed for seven days, according to the report, which also alleged that Zúñiga was involved in drug trafficking and had threatened the report’s author, a non-commissioned officer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2022, Zúñiga was accused by leftist former President Evo Morales of leading an unofficial secret but powerful group within the army, called the “Pachajchos,” that monitors coca production leaders and political opponents, including Morales. Morales alleged the group to have a “black plan” to eliminate him. Zuñiga has admitted the existence of the group, though he has not admitted to Morales accusations about its workings, saying only that it is tasked with intelligence-related duties and that non-commissioned officers and low-ranking soldiers are also part of it.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why did Zúñiga launch a coup?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Earlier this week, Zúñiga launched a series of political attacks against Morales—whose alliance with Arce has splintered in recent months, leaving Bolivia’s government in paralysis and their shared political party, the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), split across factions. Morales, who resigned the presidency in 2019 amid protests against his efforts to seek a fourth term, has announced his intention to challenge Arce in 2025 despite the country’s Constitutional Court disqualifying his candidacy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In televised statements on Monday, Zuñiga <a href=#>said</a> that Morales “can no longer be President of this country,” and that he would be willing to arrest Morales if he tried, adding that he would not allow the Constitution to “be trampled, to disobey the mandate of the people.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Morales on Tuesday <a href=#>called</a> for Zúñiga’s comments to be disavowed, saying “our democracy is increasingly in danger.” Responding to the controversy he created, Zúñiga told <a href=#>el Deber</a>: “I am a soldier of honor who is willing to offer his life for the defense and unity of the homeland. Our homeland, once again, has fallen under the threat of internal and external enemies who seek division, destabilization and hatred between Bolivians, to take over natural resources for the benefit of petty interests and power groups that respond to <a href=#>caudillismo</a>.” <a href=#>Urgente.bo</a> reported that Arce removed Zúñiga from his command on Tuesday night. (Defense minister Edmundo Novillo <a href=#>confirmed</a> Zúñiga’s Tuesday dismissal after the failed coup on Wednesday.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bolivia-coup-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bolivia-coup-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As he led the uprising on Wednesday, Zúñiga told reporters, according to the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>: “We are listening to the cry of the people because for many years an elite has taken control of the country,” and politicians are “destroying the country: look at what situation we are in, what crisis they have left us in.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The three chiefs of the armed forces have come to express our dismay,” Zúñiga <a href=#>announced</a> as he entered the palace, saying that new cabinet ministers would be sworn in “<a href=#>to restore democracy</a>.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the end, the only new appointments made were new heads of the army, navy, and air force, including Zúñiga’s replacement José Wilson Sánchez, who ordered the soldiers in the plaza to return to their barracks. (In addition to Zúñiga, Navy Vice Admiral Juan Arnez Salvador was also reportedly arrested.)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens to Zúñiga next?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When it was apparent that his putsch was going to fail, Zúñiga claimed to reporters before his arrest that Arce himself had ordered the storming of the presidential palace in an attempt to stage political theater amid his tensions with Morales: “The President told me: ‘The situation is very screwed up, very critical. It is necessary to prepare something to raise my popularity.’” He said Arce instructed him to bring out the tanks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After Zúñiga was taken into custody, Iván Lima, Bolivia’s justice minister, <a href=#>said on X</a> in response to Zúñiga’s claims that Zúñiga “lies and seeks to justify himself in a decision that is his.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lima also said that prosecutors will pursue criminal action against Zuñiga—for allegedly engaging in armed uprising against the security and sovereignty of the state, seducing troops to commit rebellion or sedition, and attacking the President and other state dignitaries—and that they will seek the maximum sentence of 15 to 20 years imprisonment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Zúñiga’s failed coup attempt <a href=#>has been condemned</a> by international governments, especially in Latin America, as well as Bolivian leaders across the spectrum, from Arce and Morales to even their right-wing opponents like former President Jeanine Anez, who said in <a href=#>a post on X</a> that the MAS should only be ousted “through the vote in 2025.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlnhXeDjqOsmqZdn7y0sYyzrKehl5Z6o7vLoq2imV2brqq4xJ1knKelpXqtscCdnKtlkae%2Fpr%2FTnpto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./agt-host-terry-crews-receives-star-on-hollywood-walk-of-fame-on-his-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'AGT' Host Terry Crews Receives Star on Hollywood Walk of Fame on His Birthday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-floor-is-meme.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Floor Is Memes: Best, Funny Jokes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
