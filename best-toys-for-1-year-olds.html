They’re super curious about the world around them and how everything works. As any parent can attest to, they’re not exactly gentle with their toys so safety and durability is a must.</p><p>Some toddlers have already developed a strong interest in toys like balls and cars or characters like Elmo, whereas others would rather bang on kitchen pots and pans or unravel the toilet paper. In general, “plush dolls, stuffed animals, stacking toys, shape sorters, lightweight balls, soft blocks, wooden toys, large puzzles with chunky pieces, simple musical instruments, and push-and-pull toys are typically well-suited for a 1-year-old’s developmental needs and interests,” says psychotherapist, parenting coach, and Founder & CEO of<a rel=nofollow href=#> Parenting Pathfinders</a> Michelle Felder, LCSW, MA. Below, I break down the best toys for 1-year-olds according to experts and parents.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-toys-for-1-year-olds>Our top picks for the best toys for 1-year olds</h2><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Wooden Car Ramp Racer</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Wooden Car Ramp Racer - Toddlers Race Track Toy Ball Track with 3 Wooden Cars and 2 Balls for 1 2 3 Year Old Boy and Girl Gifts</h3></p><p>“This classic wooden toy keeps kids entertained and helps promote hand-eye coordination,” says Amanda Vierheller, COO and Co-Founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Playgarden</a> Prep.

Toddlers can shake to hear a bell, feel fluffy fabric, look through the kaleidoscope piece, and more. Parents can practice color and shape recognition with littles as they explore and play too. As one reviewer puts it, this puzzle is “a happy medium between a cute toy and one they actually want to play with. Most of the pieces have things in them, so you also get a noise component, but my daughter loves this thing—and I don't mind looking at it.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Forest Stewardship Council</a> (FSC) plywood, FSC teak wood, cotton string, polyurethane, steel</li><li>Batteries required: No</li><li>Age range: 1+ year</li><li>Price at time of publish: $39.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>High quality</li><li>Durable</li><li>Teaches shapes and color recognition</li><li>Offers a fun sensory aspect</li><li>Aesthetically-pleasing</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>It’s expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This modern chunky puzzle is well made and lovely to look at with a fun sensory aspect on each piece to keep toddlers entertained.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Le Toy Van Petilou Sensory Shapes</a></p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-toys-for-1-year-olds>How we selected the best toys for 1-year-olds</h2><p>I spoke with multiple play experts to narrow down exactly what parents should look for in the best toys for 1-year-olds, from safety and quality to age appropriateness. I also got their input on what types of toys 1-year-olds are generally most interested in and that aid in crucial aspects of development. I relied on product suggestions from our play experts, as well as included several toys that have been used and loved in my own home by my 1-year-old.</p><p>Whether you’re a minimalist or just like to do your research, it’s important to consider the toys you’re purchasing and the value they will provide your child. Here are a few factors to keep in mind when shopping.</p><h3>Is it safe?</h3><p>At this age, children put everything in their mouths so safety is of utmost importance. Toys should be “free from small parts that could pose a choking hazard, toxic materials, or sharp edges,” says Felder.</p><h3>Is it well-made?</h3><p>You want sturdy, high-quality toys that will last even when your child chews on it or throws it across the room a hundred times. “Because of the need to explore objects orally, as well as because children at this age are prone to bang toys together, pull at its parts, and tend to play more roughly with objects, it’s important to consider the durability of the toys chosen for 1-year olds,” states Felder. “Wooden blocks, durable BPA-free plastic toys, or cloth books with reinforced stitching can be engaging options.”</p><h3>Is it developmentally and age appropriate?</h3><p>It’s always best to look at the recommended age range of a toy prior to purchasing, in addition to considering where your own child is at developmentally. “Age-appropriate toys can foster a child’s fine motor and gross motor skills, language skills, cognitive skills, and their social and emotional development,” says Felder. If a toy is too advanced, your child may get frustrated. “The size and weight of toys should also be considered, and toys that are easy for a 1-year-old to handle and manipulate should be available.”</p><h3>Is it open ended?</h3><p>Open-ended toys with unlimited ways to play are excellent for any age group, as they can flex little ones' creative muscles and often grow with kids so they can be used and enjoyed for many years to come.</p><h3>Is it interactive?</h3><p>Another aspect to consider, according to Felder, is whether the toy includes interactive features that respond to a child's actions or that encourage interactions with caregivers. “Features such as books with flaps to lift or buttons to press, or toys that play music when activated can enhance engagement and support a child's social and emotional development.”</p><h3>Does it engage the senses?</h3><p>Felder encourages parents and caregivers to consider toys that engage multiple senses and support their child’s sensory development. “Toys with a variety of textures, colors, scents, and sounds can create a rich learning experience and provide children with a deeper understanding of their world,” she says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lpKTGtHnFqKlmaV2usqK%2BjKijnatf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./as-we-speak-review-kemba-1235889696.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>As We Speak Review: Kemba Examines When Artistic Expression Is Wielded as Evidence</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-the-holidays-dont-make-everyone-feel-so-jolly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why the Holidays Dont Make Everyone Feel So Jolly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
