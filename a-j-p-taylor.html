J. P. Taylor was a British historian, recognized for transforming the study of European history through both his scholarly works and his ability to engage a wider public via television lectures. His expertise in European diplomacy, along with his articulate and often contentious viewpoints, left a significant mark.</p><p>Born in 1906 in Lancashire, Alan John Percivale Taylor grew up in an environment steeped in left-wing ideology, which would shape his own political leanings. He acquired his education from Quaker schools and further pursued modern history at Oriel College, Oxford. Although briefly affiliated with the Communist Party, he parted ways with them due to disagreements during the 1926 General Strike and instead aligned with the Labour Party.</p><p>Upon completing his studies at Oxford in 1927, Taylor embarked on his academic journey, publishing his first book on Italian unification in 1934. His career as a lecturer began at the University of Manchester, spanning from 1930 to 1938, after which he returned to Oxford. The popularity of his lectures was such that they had to be scheduled early in the day to manage the large number of attendees. He went on to become a Fellow of Magdalen College, further establishing his academic influence.</p><p>During World War II he served in the Home Guard, interacted closely with Central European émigrés, and authored works that supported Czechoslovakia while critiquing appeasement policies. Taylor was also engaged with the Political Warfare Executive and supported the Yugoslav Partisans.</p><p>1979 marked a pivotal year when Taylor resigned from the British Academy in response to the dismissal of Anthony Blunt, a spy whose academic merits Taylor felt should not be overshadowed by his espionage.</p><p>Taylor's personal life was characterized by three marriages and a large family with six children. He married Margaret Adams, followed by Eve Crosland, and eventually the Hungarian historian Éva Haraszti.</p><p>Among Taylor's prolific writings, notable works include The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847–49 (1934), The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848–1918 (1954), and the successful Bismarck: The Man and the Statesman (1955).</p><p>His book The Origins of the Second World War (1961) sparked debates by challenging prevailing beliefs about the conflict's causes, while English History 1914–1945 (1965) showcased his narrative prowess.</p><p>Beyond academia, Taylor was an active journalist for newspapers such as the Manchester Guardian and later contributed columns to the Observer and Sunday Express. He also made significant strides in the broadcasting world, where his lectures and debates captivated television and radio audiences alike.</p><p>As his later years unfolded, Taylor's battle with Parkinson’s disease led him to withdraw from writing. His final public engagement occurred in 1986, and he passed away four years later in 1990.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>March 25</a>, <a href=#>1906</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Southport, Lancashire, England</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Greatest Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Horse</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aries</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>September 7</a>, <a href=#>1990</a> (aged 84)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Parkinson's disease</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><br><h2>Quotes by A.
