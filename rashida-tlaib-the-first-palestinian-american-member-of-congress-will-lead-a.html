It’s one-sided. … [They] have these lavish trips to Israel, but they don’t show the side that I know is real, which is what’s happening to my grandmother and what’s happening to my family there.”</p><p>Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress, also said she supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to isolate Israel economically and politically over its treatment of Palestinians.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>According to The Intercept, previous AIPAC-sponsored trips to Israel by Democratic members have only included a 75-minute meeting with a Palestinian official. Though Tlaib said she is still working out her visit's details, she said she doesn't plan to meet with members of the Palestinian Authority or Israeli government. Instead, she hopes to meet with advocacy organizations and might even take the delegation to Beit Ur al-Foqa, the northern West Bank village where her grandmother lives.</p><p>Annaliese Davis, spokesperson for Democratic Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer, who has participated in the AIPAC trip in the past as a senior member of Congress, said the visit is "an opportunity for freshmen Members of Congress to learn more about regional threats and dynamics in the Middle East and the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."</p><p>"The organizers work hard to show both sides of that conflict," Davis told INSIDER. "The delegation typically travels to Ramallah and meets with Palestinian leadership, including Mahmoud Abbas and former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad when possible; they meet with representatives from NGOs focused on promoting peace efforts, such as Peace Now; and they meet with Israeli leaders from across the ideological spectrum."</p><p>Davis added that Hoyer "intends to once again serve as the senior member on a delegation of Members of Congress to Israel next year," though the trip hasn't yet been planned.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Pro-Palestine groups in the U.S. hope that Tlaib's trip will give Congress members a "refreshening perspective" of the situation in the West Bank. Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, told INSIDER that past Congressional trips to Israel have provided "skewed" perspectives of the conflict that benefit only one side of the issue.</p><p>"Going over there and seeing for yourself what's taking place is one of the most important things that anybody could do and, for members of Congress in particular, to be able to look at the situation on the ground first-hand and to have to think about the role the U.S. government plays in creating that situation on the ground, that situation of injustice, is, I think, very important," Munayyer added.</p><p>Tlaib, who called Trump Administration's Muslim ban "textbook bigotry" and, with Ilhan Omar, will become one of the first Muslim Congresswomen in American history, has vowed to propose legislation that will "drastically expand U.S. civil rights protections to cover discriminatory impacts." Though it is still unknown which members of Congress will join Tlaib for the West Bank visit, the Congresswoman-elect said her end goal is to humanize Palestinians.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=e5b6dd55-f280-37ef-a5b9-3a20a176964c>Minnesota, Michigan send first Muslim women to US Congress</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7z6ijoqyZmMBwvsCsn6KckWLBra3Im2StoJVis6q%2B0q1kqZmcmsC1tc2imKdlkaKys7XCmqVmpZWir6a%2BjKidZpufo7SzsdKsZLChnKF6rbHAnWSaZ6Ftwbl92Gw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./la-nutrinavette-un-jeu-sur-lalimentation-sante-sillonne-brest-metropole.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Un escape game mobile pour manger mieux Brest (29)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./patrice-vergriete-plaide-pour-une-plus-grande-decentralisation-de-la-politique-du-logement.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Patrice Vergriete plaide pour une plus grande dcentralisation de la politique du logement</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
