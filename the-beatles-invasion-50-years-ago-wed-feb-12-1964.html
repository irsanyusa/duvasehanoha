The constant encroachment and the extraneous obligations were exhausting. There were none of the boundaries they were used to in England.</p><p>On the morning of Feb. 12 they were put on&nbsp;a slow-moving train rattling up the East Coast,&nbsp;while manager Brian Epstein and his staff flew the shuttle&nbsp;back to <a href=#>New York</a>. The boys, for their part,&nbsp;were chaperoned by an entourage of journalists&nbsp;who refused to give them a moment’s peace. “We enjoyed it in the early days,” George recalled, but “the only place we&nbsp;ever got any peace was when we got in the suite&nbsp;and locked ourselves in the bathroom.”</p><p>But that wasn’t about to happen anytime&nbsp;soon. The platforms were mobbed with several&nbsp;thousand fans when the train pulled into Pennsylvania&nbsp;Station. At the last minute, the cops detached the&nbsp;Beatles’ car from the rest of the train and diverted&nbsp;it to an isolated platform. A plan to take&nbsp;them up a special elevator was foiled by fans, so&nbsp;the boys charged up the closest set of stairs and&nbsp;jumped into a taxi idling on Seventh Avenue.</p><p>They were overdue for rehearsal at Carnegie&nbsp;Hall, where they were scheduled to appear twice&nbsp;that evening.</p><p>Even for the Beatles, Carnegie Hall was no&nbsp;ordinary gig. The place was a shrine; the name&nbsp;alone humbled any musician. But if the Beatles were in awe of entering the place, they didn’t show it. They relaxed in the prestigious green room just behind the stage,&nbsp;chain-smoking American cigarettes and drinking lukewarm tea, completely unfazed by the remarkable&nbsp;surroundings. On the walls just outside hung autographs of the hall’s most famous&nbsp;denizens: Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Mahler, Caruso, Pons, Handy, Cliburn, Casals, Rostropovich,&nbsp;Callas. Until that night, Bill Haley & the Comets and&nbsp;Bo Diddley had been the only rock ’n’ roll acts to&nbsp;set foot in Carnegie Hall. Apparently, its board&nbsp;of directors didn’t dig the groove. Neither Elvis&nbsp;nor Buddy Holly was granted a date, not even&nbsp;the Everly Brothers.</p><p>As the lights went down, the 2,900 concertgoers,&nbsp;most of them teenage girls, delivered a protracted&nbsp;scream that never let up for the duration. “It was&nbsp;mayhem,” recalled Dan Daniel, a longtime local DJ. “It was the most piercing, uncomfortable sound I’d ever heard.</p><p>The five of us held our hands over our ears. Fifty&nbsp;years later, my ears are still ringing.”&nbsp;The manic response had a similar effect on&nbsp;the Beatles. You could see it in the way they comported&nbsp;themselves onstage. Their timing seemed&nbsp;herky-jerky; they were slightly off stride. There&nbsp;was no way for them to connect through the&nbsp;impenetrable wall of screams. Meanwhile, no&nbsp;one in the seats could hear a word they sang. It was absolute “bedlam” in that place, according to the editor of Melody Maker, who covered the&nbsp;show in an article aptly titled “The Night Carnegie Hall Went Berserk.” A wild horde tore up&nbsp;and down the aisles. Girls lobbed a jungle’s worth&nbsp;of stuffed <a href=#>animals</a>. It was a free-for-all, which the ushers watched with goggle-eyed horror.</p><img decoding=async width=2247 height=2994 alt="The Beatles Invasion: The Inside Story of of the Two-Week Tour that Rocked America, by Bob Spitz.

They’d seen it before—and worse—back home, but&nbsp;their music always managed to upstage the chaos. Not this night. If at first they were amused&nbsp;by the antics, they grew frustrated by the audience’s refusal to listen. After the seventh song,&nbsp;John had had enough. The New York Times reported that he throttled the mike, “looked the&nbsp;audience sternly in the mouth, and yelled, ‘Shut up!’ ” Not that it did him much good. “Yells and&nbsp;shouts rose to an ear-shattering volume,” Melody Maker noted. After a concert lasting only 34&nbsp;minutes—as with an identical show immediately following it—the Beatles bowed, dropped their&nbsp;instruments and headed for the wings.</p><p>This is the&nbsp;sixth&nbsp;installment in a series of excerpts from the new TIME book,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Beatles Invasion: The Inside Story of the Two-Week Tour That Rocked America</a>, by Bob Spitz.
