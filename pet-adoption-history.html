The growth in <a href=#>pandemic-era pet adoption</a> continues the trend of Americans turning to their pets for companionship in tough times. As TIME put it in a 1974 cover story, “During wars, insurrections and depressions, particularly, pet ownership seems to proliferate. Even in today’s recession-inflation battered economy, when the care and feeding of pets would seem an exorbitant load on the family budget, there are more and more pet owners in the U.S.—deriving, perhaps, psychological sustenance from what Kipling called the dog’s ‘love unflinching that cannot lie.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But though shelters and rescues have been <a href=# rel=noopener>rising in popularity</a> in recent years, with June observed as adopt-a-cat month, their history in America is more than 150 years old.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While most Americans may associate the idea of animal shelter with adopting a pet cat or dog, the first such places tended to involve horses, with activists focused on the welfare of animals who were a key mode of transportation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then, on April 14, 1869, Caroline Earle White and a group of women activists established what’s considered the country’s first animal shelter, in Bensalem, Pa., outside of Philadelphia. In addition to horses, its mission expanded “to provide as soon as possible, a Refuge for lost and homeless dogs, where they could be kept until homes could be found for them, or they be otherwise disposed of.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The whole notion of a shelter, or even a municipal pound, as a place where you could go and find a pet, really took hold in the latter part of the 19th century and then has grown steadily ever since,” says historian Bernie Unti, a senior principal strategist at the Humane Society of the United States.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the Progressive Era, just as social-reform activists called for the humane treatment of factory workers in an era of rapid industrialization and urbanization, so too were activists calling for the humane treatment of animals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That foundation set the country up for the post-World War II period, when pets became seen as part of the quintessential suburban American family.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TIME’s Dec. 23, 1974, <a href=#>cover story on “The American Pet”</a> declared that “the U.S. today is undergoing what can only be described as an animalthusian explosion” in which “pet ownership has become almost as sacred a democratic right as if it had been written into the Constitution.” At the time, about 60% of American households had a pet, and it was becoming more common to pamper them. Today, the American Pet Products Association says the number is<a href=# rel=noopener> two-thirds of American households</a> (67%); in March, pet products spending <a href=# rel=noopener>surpassed the $100 billion mark</a> for the first time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pet.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Pet-keeping has become more intensive, just like child rearing has,” says Katherine C. Grier, author of Pets in America: A History.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But as the number of breeders <a href=# rel=noopener>increased</a>, so did the number of cats and dogs—not all of which had homes with those pampering families. The country now had to figure out what to do with the cats and dogs that had nowhere to go.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By the 1970s, spay and neuter technology became more widely used, and animal-welfare groups like the Humane Society of the United States promoted the motto of “legislate, educate, sterilize” to reduce the number of unwanted animals. Seeing mixed-breed dogs like <a href=# rel=noopener>Benji</a> on the big screen also helped normalize pet adoptions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Pushing adoption and trying to make the shelter as the first place to look for a pet was a big part of this overall strategy,” says Unti. Adoption is “a big part of” what reduced the number of animals loose in the streets, and in recent years they’ve only gotten more possible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Among pet dogs, the percentage adopted from shelters increased from 15% in 2006 to over 35% in 2016. The Internet and <a href=# rel=noopener>social media</a>, especially PSAs that<a href=# rel=noopener> the Ad Council </a>started in 2009, are thought to have helped drive the rise in awareness of adoptions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Andrew Rowan, Chief Program Officer at WellBeing International, tells TIME there are now 5,000 animal shelters and animal rescue groups in the U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Animal welfare experts believe the adoption of First Dog Major will also continue to raise awareness of animal shelters and rescue groups as places to adopt pets. The Bidens join a long tradition of high-profile figures aiming to increase adoptions even more. Many celebrities have founded animal shelters: dancer <a href=# rel=noopener>Irene Castle founded Orphans of the Storm in 1928</a> and went onto become the President of the Westchester County, N.Y., Humane Society; Doris Day was known as <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Dog Catcher of Beverly Hills”; </a>and The Price Is Right host Bob Barker <a href=# rel=noopener>urged viewers to make sure their pets were spayed and neutered.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s a mission that, even after all these years, remains necessary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaGRsgHGDjqmcrWWRmbyxwMiopWagmajBsL7YaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./une-petite-evolution-des-centres-de-gestion-reportee-au-projet-de-loi-sur-les-contractuels.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Une petite volution des centres de gestion reporte au projet de loi sur les contractuels</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nevada-senate-race-adam-laxalt-catherine-cortez-masto.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Fight for Latino Voters in Nevada Is the Future of U.S. Politics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./big-boobs-3-women-talk-to-us-about-their-bust-related-struggles.html>Big Boobs: 3 women talk to us about their bust-related struggles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./groupements-hospitaliers-de-territoire-le-comite-de-suivi-se-met-en-place-marisol-touraine-veut.html>le comit de suivi se met en place, Marisol Touraine veut rassurer les lus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./transports-en-ile-de-france-les-nouveaux-contrats-sncf-et-ratp-adoptes.html>les nouveaux contrats SNCF et RATP adopts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paramount-plus-biggest-challenge-boosting-subscriber-engagement-1236072682.html>Paramount+ Biggest Challenge: Boosting Subscriber Engagement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./westminster-abbey-consecrated.html>Westminster Abbey Consecrated (Famous Drawing)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog.
